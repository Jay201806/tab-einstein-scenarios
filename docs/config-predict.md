# Predict Configuration Options

The options below control how content is displayed on the Predict page within the extension.

## Text Size (Px)

The text size, in pixels, of content.

## Text Weight

Allows you to switch between bold and normal text weights for content.

## Prefix

Text to be added _before_ the prediction result in the extension.

## Suffix

Text to be added _after_ the prediction result in the extension.

## Decimal Places

Number of decimal places to use when displaying the prediction result.

## Use Thousands Separator

Whether to use a comma or not when displaying numbers larger than 999. Currently only supports using a comma as a separator so 1000 would be displayed as 1,000.

## Percentage

Defines whether the prediction result should be displayed as a percentage. Choosing this option will result in the prediction result being multiplied by 100 and having the "%" sign added afterwards. So, 0.25 would be displayed as 25%.

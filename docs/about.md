# About

Let's go through the "four W's"

## Who?

Who built this? Uh, me I guess. Oh, hi, my name is John. I do work for Tableau. I'm a Solutions Engineer and I support our strategic partner accounts (i.e. big global consulting companies like Deloitte, Accenture, etc). I'm a huge data nerd at heart and I love tinkering and building weird new things.

## What?

Uh, well, this extension.

## Why?

Why develop this? Well, it's a good question. I'll start by saying that I'm hopeful that native support will come for this functionality and will completely obviate the need for this extension. But, the truth is, Tableau and Einstein are both big, complicated, mature platforms and combining the two takes a high degree of care, thoughtfulness, and skill. Yes, I work at Tableau and, yes, I'm 100% confiden that we'll get there but I also think it'll take a little time to do it right. So, in the meantime, I built this because I want people to see how amazingly powerful it is to combine these two platforms.

## When?

I have no idea why it's important but I built the Beta version of this over about a week in May of 2020.

## Wait, what about the "one H?!"

Fine, fine. No need to get pushy. Happy to share how I built this.

Most of the code is TypeScript. I also lean heavily on React to render the UI and Python to manage the back end. I also used the [Tableau UI React Library](https://tableau.github.io/tableau-ui/) liberally throughout the extension.

Honestly, I used a bunch of stuff to make all of this work and if you want the full list, just check out the `package.json` and `requirements.txt` files in the repo. Mercifully, lots of super smart people came before me and made this whole process much easier. If they hadn't, well, I probably wouldn't have built this.
